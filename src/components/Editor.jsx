import React from 'react';
import Preview from './Preview';

const initiaState = `# Welcome to my React Markdown Previewer!

## This is a sub-heading...
### And here's some other cool stuff:
  
Heres some code, \`<div></div>\`, between 2 backticks.

\`\`\`
// this is multi-line code:

function anotherExample(firstLine, lastLine) {
  if (firstLine == '\`\`\`' && lastLine == '\`\`\`') {
    return multiLineCode;
  }
}
\`\`\`
  
You can also make text **bold**... whoa!
Or _italic_.
Or... wait for it... **_both!_**
And feel free to go crazy ~~crossing stuff out~~.

There's also [links](https://www.freecodecamp.com), and
> Block Quotes!

And if you want to get really crazy, even tables:

Wild Header | Crazy Header | Another Header?
------------ | ------------- | ------------- 
Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....
And here. | Okay. | I think we get it.

- And of course there are lists.
  - Some are bulleted.
     - With different indentation levels.
        - That look like this.


1. And there are numbererd lists too.
1. Use just 1s if you want! 
1. But the list goes on...
- Even if you use dashes or asterisks.
* And last but not least, let's not forget embedded images:

export const Editor = (props) => {
    const [md, setMd] = useState(initalState);

    const updateMd = (e) => {
        setMd(e.target.value)
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <div>
                <h3 className="text-center">Enter Your Markdown Here</h3>
                <textarea type="text" className="editor-input" value={md} onChange={updateMd} />
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3 className="text-center">Preview</h3>
                <Preview markDown={md} />
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
